# Unsupervised Learning: Cryptocurrency Clustering

## Overview

This project demonstrates the application of unsupervised learning techniques to cluster cryptocurrencies based on their features. Unsupervised learning is a machine learning paradigm where the algorithm discovers patterns and structures in the data without the need for labeled output. In this project, we explore the unsupervised learning concepts used for cryptocurrency clustering.

## Project Structure

The project follows a structured approach to unsupervised learning:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - Gather cryptocurrency data.
   - Preprocess the data to handle missing values and ensure consistency.

2. **Feature Selection**:
   - Choose relevant features for clustering, focusing on numeric attributes like price change percentages and trading volumes.

3. **Clustering Algorithms**:
   - Utilize K-Means clustering, a common unsupervised learning algorithm, to group cryptocurrencies.
   - Experiment with different values of K (number of clusters) to find the optimal clustering solution.

4. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**:
   - Apply PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data.
   - PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that helps improve clustering results by reducing noise in the data.

5. **Visualization**:
   - Create visualizations to interpret and analyze the clusters.
   - Visualize the results using scatter plots and PCA plots.

## Dependencies
